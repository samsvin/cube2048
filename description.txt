Cubes 2048.io is an addictive online game that fuses Snake and 2048. Get a bigger number by collecting free cubes and eating other players with a smaller number than you. Your cubes with the same value that bump into one another will merge.

How to Play
Merge blocks to grow
Cubes 2048 turns 2048 into a 3D .io game! Slide around the arena picking up blocks to get bigger. Picking up two of the same number will merge them into a single block as the total sum of both.

Consume the competition
In Cubes 2048.io, you can eat any number smaller than you - including your opponents. At the same time, you should be wary of bigger opponents coming to gobble you up or take a big chunk out of your block supply!
